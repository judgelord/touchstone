## Community Toy Storage Design

- The shed-style roof will be of thick steel, charcoal to match the gazebo. 
- The steep slope, 5 feet high at the front, 2 feet high at the back, is designed to keep snow, leaves, and kids off. 
- Being 5-feet tall at the tall end will **minimize visual impact**. Most community members' sightlines will not be blocked unless they are standing right in front of it. 
- The north-facing edge, being 2 feet tall also greatly reduces the risk of **wind damage**.
