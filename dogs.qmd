Where?

------------------------------------------------------------- Possible location --->


## Need 

- Dogs need exercise
  - exercise makes dogs more calm
- Dogs are happy when they can play
- There is no dog run in walking distance, especially difficult for people who don't drive (Krista, Devin & Kristy, etc.)




## Support 


## Ideas 

- [Dog park club](https://thestantonfoundation.org/assets/canine/Dog-Park-Resources/UC-Davis-Study-Dog-Park-Maintenance.pdf) organizes and pays for initial construction and maintenance

## Concerns 

- Will there be noise? 
- Who will pay for it? 
- Will it smell? 
- Who is in charge of maintenance? 
- Is there liability? 
- Will there be limits on the number of dogs or who can use it? (e.g., can GO use it?)



## What does the research say? 

Common concerns that research shows to be ["relatively
infrequent"](https://thestantonfoundation.org/assets/canine/Dog-Park-Resources/UC-Davis-Study-Dog-Park-Maintenance.pdf) 

- safety to humans and other dogs
- noise generated from a concentration of barking dogs
- sanitation problems from the build-up of feces
- disturbance of wildlife or native plants

Concerns to think through

- ADA accessibility
- maintenance plan
- exercise areas rules
  - hours
  - number of dogs at a time
  - user responsibilities
